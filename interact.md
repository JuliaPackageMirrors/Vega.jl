# Using Interact.jl and Vega in Jupyter Notebooks

The [Interact](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Interact.jl) package provides interactive widgets such as sliders, dropdowns and checkboxes to play with the Julia code that generates your plots.

Here is a simple example using the Distributions package:

    using Interact, Vega, Distributions
    @manipulate for μ in -10:10, σ = 0.1:0.5:5.1
        x = -20:0.01:20
        lineplot(y = pdf(Normal(μ, σ), x), x=x)
    end
